## Dataset for "Solving the Maximum Cut Problem Using Harris Hawk Optimization Algorithm"

This dataset is associated with the research article titled _"Solving the Maximum Cut Problem Using Harris Hawk Optimization Algorithm"_. The dataset contains instances used in the study to evaluate the performance of the Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) algorithm on the Maximum Cut Problem.

## Contents

This dataset includes **33 `.txt` files**, each representing a graph instance used in the study. The structure of each file is as follows:

1.  **First Line**:  
    Contains two integers:
    
    -   **V**: Number of nodes in the graph.
    -   **E**: Number of edges in the graph.
2.  **Next E Lines**:  
    Each line contains three integers:
    
    -   **u**: The starting node of the edge.
    -   **v**: The ending node of the edge.
    -   **w**: The weight of the edge connecting nodes **u** and **v**.
